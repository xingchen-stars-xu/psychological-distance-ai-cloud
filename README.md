# Bridging Psychological Distance: Understanding Student Perceptions Toward AI and Cloud Computing

This project investigates how university students perceive advanced technologies—specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing—in educational contexts. By applying **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)** and **Multiple Linear Regression**, this study reveals how psychological distance varies by student demographics, informing inclusive technology design and adoption strategies.

## Research Goals

1. **Measure** psychological distance across two dimensions:
   - *Social distance*: “I feel that the field of AI is accessible and open to people like me.”
   - *Hypothetical distance*: “I feel informed about the latest developments and uses of AI in various fields.”

2. **Identify** how student demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, major) influence perceived distance.

3. **Translate** findings into actionable insights for inclusive tech education and engagement.
